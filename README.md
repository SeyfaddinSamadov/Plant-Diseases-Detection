# 🌱 Plant Diseases Detection Project

This project utilizes a deep learning model to identify plant diseases from images. It is based on a dataset from Kaggle and predicts the disease type with potential solutions.

---

## 🧩 Features
- **Disease Detection**: Automatically classifies plant diseases using images.
- **Solutions**: Provides tailored solutions for each identified disease.
- **Streamlit Integration**: User-friendly interface for image uploads and predictions.

---

## 📚 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [Plant Village Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease).  
It contains labeled images of healthy and diseased plants across various classes, including:
- **Apple**: Apple Scab, Black Rot, etc.
- **Tomato**: Bacterial Spot, Early Blight, Leaf Mold, etc.
- **Corn**: Gray Leaf Spot, Northern Leaf Blight, etc.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for building the model.
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for creating the interface.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Data handling and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization (optional).
